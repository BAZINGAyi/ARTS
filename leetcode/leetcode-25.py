# Question: Reverse Nodes in k-Group
# Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and
# return its modified list.
#
# k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked
# list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k then left-out nodes in the
# end should remain as it is.

# Example:
# Given 1->2->3->4->5.
# For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5
# For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5

# Note:
# Only constant extra memory is allowed.
# You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes itself
# may be changed.
