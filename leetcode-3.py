# Given a string, find the length of the longest substring
# without repeating characters.

# Type: The sliding window

# example one
# Input: "abcabcbb"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

# Input: "bbbbb"
# Output: 1
# Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

# Input: "pwwkew"
# Output: 3
# Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
#              Note that the answer must be a substring,
#              "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.
